# miniSphere-wasmtest

I'm using this to test/experiment with WebAssembly support in miniSphere. It's currently very unstable and only works with WebAssembly files compiled in Go. Eventually I want to make it more flexible and compatible with any miniSphere compatible WebAssembly file.

Here is a screenshot of it running a simple hello world program that gets `Sphere.Name` from miniSphere and prints that.
